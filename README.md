# hello-world
For Unstructured Data Analytics and Github familiarization

My name is Rongel Yee, and (at this moment) a student at the University of Notre Dame studying Business Analytics and Economics. I am originally from Las Vegas, Nevada, but I have plans to work at Epic in Madison, Wisconsin in the Fall. Anyways, my favorite hobbies are listening to music (always blasting hip-hop/r&b) and watching the NBA
